        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree from Patkai Christian College in Dimapur, Nagaland
          <p>Fueled by my passion for technology, I pursued a Master's in Computer Application program at Jorhat Engineering College in Jorhat, Assam.</p>
           <p>This program ignited my interest in a career within the IT field. During my studies,
           I honed my skills through various projects in web development and Java networking. As the tech industry thrives on continuous learning, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and adapt to new skills.
          <p>
          In 2020, I seized the opportunity to attend the University of Limerick, Ireland, for a year of training in EdTech.</p>
          <p> 
          Further motivated by my research aspirations in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I embarked on an MTech program in Computer Science in 2024. 
          </p>
          <p>
          My unwavering belief is that learning and achievement have no limit for those passionate about reaching their goals. I'm excited to continue learning and excelling in my computer science journey.
