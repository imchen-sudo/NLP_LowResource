        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Limainla Imchen, often called Aien or Imchen, I belong to the Ao-Naga tribe from Nagaland, Northeast India. As a passionate learner, I'm always eager to explore new things. Fascinated by technology and its potential to solve real-world problems, I enjoy acquiring new skills and sharing my knowledge with others. My goal is to continue learning and growing in the field of computer science.

<p>Beyond academics, I love hiking, biking, baking, and crafting, believing in the importance of a well-rounded lifestyle. As an independent woman, I've always strived to learn and grow, aiming for a stable and bright future.</p>
<p>
I've started learning different languages, including the challenging Mandarin Chinese. This linguistic journey has sparked my enthusiasm for technology, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing.</p>

<p>Although I've traveled extensively and learned much about different cultures, my heart remains deeply connected to my homeland. My future plan is to return and contribute positively to my people in any way possible.</p>
